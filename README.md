# thermal-vision 
![build status](https://api.travis-ci.com/IoTPanic/thermal-vision.svg?branch=master)

This rust application is for visualizing data from a comma separated file that is the output from a thermal sensor array. **This is my first rust application I'm sorry for how bad it is, I know**. Not intended for others to use, will not be maintained. Used the piston getting started example as sort of a base.
